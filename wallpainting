3.11 Program: Painting a wall (Python 3)
(1) Prompt the user to input a wall's height and width. Calculate and output the wall's area. 
(2) Extend to also calculate and output the amount of paint in gallons needed to paint the wall. 
Assume a gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. Store this value in a variable.
(3) Extend to also calculate and output the number of 1 gallon cans needed to paint the wall. 
Hint: Use a math function to round up to the nearest gallon.
(4) Extend by prompting the user for a color they want to paint the walls. 
Calculate and output the total cost of the paint cans depending on which color is chosen. 
Hint: Use a dictionary to associate each paint color with its respective cost. 
Red paint costs $35 per gallon can, blue paint costs $25 per gallon can, and green paint costs $23 per gallon can.

import math


paintColor={'red':35,'blue':25,'green':23}


wallHeight=float(input('Enter wall height (feet): \n'))
wallWidth=float(input('Enter wall width (feet): \n'))
wallArea=wallHeight * wallWidth


print('Wall area: ' + str(wallArea) + ' square feet')


Paint_needed= (wallArea/350)
print('Paint needed: ' +str(Paint_needed) + ' gallons')


Cans_needed=math.ceil(Paint_needed)
print('Cans needed: ' +str(Cans_needed) +' can(s)\n')


color_choose=input("Choose a color to paint the wall: \n")
print("Cost of purchasing " +color_choose+" paint: $" +str(paintColor[color_choose] * math.ceil(Paint_needed)))
